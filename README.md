## node-runner

#### A self-refreshing Javascript code-runner in NodeJS.

This is the accompanying source code to a **[walkthrough](https://medium.com/@erikfox/how-to-build-a-self-refreshing-javascript-code-runner-in-nodejs-ee1301d65877)** that I wrote for a friend who asked for a first-timer's introduction to node. It's intended to help new Node users become familiar with npm packages, node project structure, and build flow.

Build it yourself by using the **[walkthrough](https://medium.com/@erikfox/how-to-build-a-self-refreshing-javascript-code-runner-in-nodejs-ee1301d65877)** (recommended for new Node users), or download the source from git to play with it right away.

To run, open a `terminal` window in the **node-runner** directory and enter

    $ gulp
